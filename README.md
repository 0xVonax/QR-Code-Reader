# QR Code Scanning App

# Project Summary
Many of us have applications on our phones that will allow us to read QR codes that will direct us to various links from a shortcut, but I wanted to develop a similar application both in order to contribute to my own portfolio and to learn new things in software and improve myself.

# Home
The homepage of the application will first ask you for the necessary permissions to access your device's camera. If you give the permissions, the application will be able to read the codes from the camera and then If it reads the QR code, it will direct you to the link page.

# Direction Page
After scanning the QR code, you will be able to see the address of the website you will be directed to on the link page that the application directs you to.
